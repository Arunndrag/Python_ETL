# Python ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This project is a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to extract data from multiple sources, transform the data into the required format, and load it into a target system (e.g., a database or file storage). This pipeline is modular, efficient, and customizable for various data processing tasks.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Supports reading from various data sources such as CSV, JSON, APIs, and databases.
- **Data Transformation**: Handles cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and formatting of data.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the transformed data into a database or writes it to files.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to track each step of the ETL process.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with customizable retry mechanisms.
